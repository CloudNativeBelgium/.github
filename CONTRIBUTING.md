## Wording and Review

- Keep listing text factual and neutral.
- Wording questions are resolved in issues or PRs; we do not merge contested text.

## Shared Resources

Shared repos are opt-in and only created when multiple groups agree to collaborate. Ownership and access are documented in each repo’s README.
