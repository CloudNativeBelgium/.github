# Governance

## Scope

This document describes how Cloud Native Belgium (this org) makes decisions about the shared index, shared resources, and any collaboration repositories under the CloudNativeBelgium GitHub org.

## Roles

Roles exist at two scopes: Cloud Native Belgium (this org) and each individual group. A person may hold the same role in both scopes, but responsibilities do not cross boundaries.

### Cloud Native Belgium (this org) Roles

- Contributors: anyone proposing changes via issues or pull requests in this org.
- Maintainers: reviewers who merge changes and keep the index current in this org. Maintainers are added by consensus of existing maintainers.
- Neutral chairs: individuals who facilitate coordination across groups without representing any single group.

### Group Roles (each community)

- Contributors: anyone proposing changes within that group’s repositories.
- Maintainers: reviewers who merge changes within that group’s repositories.
- Chairs: individuals who facilitate coordination within that group.

## Decision-Making

- We prefer consensus in public issues and pull requests.
- If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may decide after documenting the tradeoffs and giving time for feedback.
- The default feedback window is 7 days unless maintainers agree to extend it.

## Listing Changes

- Additions, updates, or removals to the index happen via pull requests.
- Each listing must be approved by a maintainer of Cloud Native Belgium (this org).
- Disputes over wording are resolved in the PR discussion; we do not merge contested text.
- Listings can be removed at the group’s request, or by maintainer consensus if the group is inactive or unresponsive.
- For inactivity checks, maintainers will contact the group via maintainers listed in its repo or the channels described on its group page; if there is no response after 60 days, the listing may be removed without further outreach.

## Shared Resources

- Shared repos are opt-in and only created when two or more groups agree to collaborate.
- Ownership and access are documented in the repo README.

## Changes to This Document

Propose edits via pull requests. We prefer small, clear changes and consensus in the discussion before merging.
