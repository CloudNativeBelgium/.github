# 🌥️ Cloud Native Belgium 🇧🇪

We're a neutral discovery layer for Cloud Native groups and individuals in Belgium. We help people find what already exists, understand what each group does, and connect through their own channels. We also enable lightweight collaboration and cross-promotion when it makes sense.

## Neutrality & Autonomy

- Listing a community here does not imply endorsement or representation.
- Each community keeps full autonomy over its repos, branding, and messaging.
- Cloud Native Belgium (this org) does not speak for groups; it only links to them.

## Groups

This is a simple index of communities with a short description and a link to their repo or website.
Descriptions are maintained by each group; open an issue if you want to refine wording.

| Name | Description | Status | Details |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ---- |
| Cloud Native Brussels | Official CNCF chapter with activities across Belgium | Active | [cncf-community-brussels](https://github.com/CloudNativeBelgium/cncf-community-brussels/blob/main/README.md) |
| Cloud Native Belgium (ex. Kubernetes Belgium) | Independent Cloud Native group in Belgium | Active | [meetup.com-events](https://github.com/CloudNativeBelgium/meetup.com-events) |

## Individuals

Including individuals is a core part of the organization. We recognize speakers, organizers, contributors, and other active community members even if they are not part of a listed group. Individuals who are not affiliated with a specific community are encouraged to participate and can serve as neutral chairs.
