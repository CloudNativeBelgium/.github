# 🌥️ Cloud Native Belgium 🇧🇪

> Bringing people together for inspiration, collaboration, and fellowship.

We’re a community of enthusiasts, professionals, and newcomers passionate about the Cloud Native ecosystem.  
From Kubernetes to containers, observability to edge—if it's part of the CNCF landscape, we're into it.

## ✨ Our Mission

To connect people, companies, and technologies in Belgium through fun, inclusive, and hands-on experiences.

We foster an **open, welcoming environment**—regardless of background, age, gender, or race.

## The different meetups!

As the Cloud Native ecosystem continues to grow, multiple meetup groups have emerged across Belgium, each organizing local events and initiatives. To reduce confusion and create synergies, we decided to collaborate across these groups and centralize shared resources, communication, and community efforts under Cloud Native Belgium.

We are currently organized through two different channels, each with respecitive organisers.

* The [CNCF Brussels Community events](https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-brussels/).
* The [Cloud Native Belgium meetups](https://www.meetup.com/cloudnative-belgium/).
